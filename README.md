# Emotion-Classifier

This model helps us to determine the mood of the person by analyzing the face of the human. I have only kept two emotions right now and that are happy and sad bacause I wanted to make the website working first and then adding more features. 
Firstly, I downloaded the images using the SerpAPI that downloads images directly from google and save into the local device. Then I used Roboflow to label all the images and divide it into the train, test and validation. After that the given model by AI Camp was used for training and then the trained model was uploaded to Hugging Face. Then, I used Replit to make the website and thanks to AI Camp for providing the template to make my work easy.
